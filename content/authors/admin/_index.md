I answer business questions with data.

As a private sector analyst, I have:
- estimated price elasticities
- coded model backtesting for multiple problem domains
  - loan repayment
  - home prices
- automated workflows for production model monitoring

At the Federal Reserve, I:
- coded backtests of job growth forecasting models
- analyzed firm-level information from internal and external databases
- delivered project presentations and published reports available online

As I've learned about statistical methods in the office,
I also studied them through Texas A&M.
I previously studied economics at Purdue.
