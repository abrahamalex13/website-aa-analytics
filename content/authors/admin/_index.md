I'm committed to answering business questions with data.

As a data analyst in the private sector, 
I've coded backtests of competing home price
prediction models. I've also 
built new automated workflows to 
monitor production model accuracy.

At the Federal Reserve, I coded backtests
of competing job growth forecasting models.
I regularly analyzed firm-level information
from internal and external databases. I've presented
projects through speeches and published reports
available online.

As I've learned about statistical methods in the office,
I've also studied them through Texas A&M.
I previously studied economics at Purdue.
